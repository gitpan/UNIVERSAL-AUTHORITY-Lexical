NAME
    UNIVERSAL::AUTHORITY::Lexical - an AUTHORITY method for every class,
    within a lexical scope

SYNOPSIS
     if (HTML::HTML5::Writer->AUTHORITY ne HTML::HTML5::Builder->AUTHORITY)
     {
       warn "Closely intertwined modules with different authors!\n";
       warn "There may be trouble ahead...";
     }

     # Only trust STEVAN's releases
     Moose->AUTHORITY('cpan:STEVAN'); # dies if doesn't match

DESCRIPTION
    This module adds an "AUTHORITY" method to the "UNIVERSAL" package, which
    works along the same lines as the "VERSION" function. Because it is
    defined in "UNIVERSAL", it becomes instantly available as a method for
    any blessed objects, and as a class method for any package.

    The method is defined only for the lexical scope you import this package
    into. For example:

      {
        use UNIVERSAL::AUTHORITY::Lexical;
        say Moose->AUTHORITY;
      }
      say Moose->AUTHORITY;  # no such method, dies.

    The authority of a package can be defined like this:

     package MyApp;
     BEGIN { $MyApp::AUTHORITY = 'cpan:JOEBLOGGS'; }

    The authority should be a URI identifying the person, team, organisation
    or trained chimp responsible for the release of the package. The
    pseudo-URI scheme "cpan:" is the most commonly used identifier.

  "AUTHORITY"
    Called with no parameters returns the authority of a CPAN release.

  "AUTHORITY($test)"
    If passed a test, will croak if the test fails. The authority is tested
    against the test using something approximating Perl 5.10's smart match
    operator. (Briefly, you can pass a string for "eq" comparison, a regular
    expression, a code reference to use as a callback, or an array reference
    that will be grepped.)

BUGS
    Currently "UNIVERSAL->can('AUTHORITY')" returns false.
